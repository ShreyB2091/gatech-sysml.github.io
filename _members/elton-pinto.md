I am Sutter Hill Ventures Codepoint Fellow-In-Residence with Observe and Luminary Cloud.

I'm interested in tackling problems at the intersection between programming languages and systems. During my master's, I worked with Daan Leijen on prototyping an implementation of Perceus memory management for OCaml.

During my undergrad I was part of TINKER lab where I was advised by Prof. Thomas Conte and Dr. Jeff Young. While there, I wrote a space-efficient implementation of the quantum verification of matrix products (QVMP) algorithm.
