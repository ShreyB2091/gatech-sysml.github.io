Hi! I'm Mayank, a second-year MSCS student at Georgia Tech, specializing in computing systems. My interests lie in low-level systems optimizations and high-performance computing, with a focus on fine-grained techniques that maximize system performance under tight hardware constraints.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at a high-frequency trading firm for over two years, where I built ultra low-latency systems for market data processing and algorithmic trading. My work focused on optimizing critical path performance and implementing kernel bypass networking solutions to achieve sub-microsecond response times. Prior to that, I completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from IIT Delhi in 2022.
