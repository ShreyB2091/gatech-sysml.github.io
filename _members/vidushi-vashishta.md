I am currently a software enginner at Google, before that I was MSCS grad student at Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA. Previously, I worked as a Software Development Engineer at Adobe Systems, India. At Adobe, I accumulated extensive experience by working on web applications, with a focus on the design, implementation, and maintenance of backend infrastructures of microservices.

I have made prolific contributions to research in the field of applied Machine Learning for five years. I have presented my work in top IEEE conferences and published it in accredited journals. I am always open to discussion on possible collaborations!
